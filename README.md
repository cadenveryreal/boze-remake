# boze remake
i recommend actually buying the client since its better and will actually get updates unlike this one unless youre very very very broke

it's a 1:1 remake, so everything will be the same as boze 1.01
                  
                                         [how to install]

this is for minecraft 1.19.2 and uses the fabric library, so download the fabric installer, download a minecraft version with whatever fabric version doesnt really matter as long its higher than 11 and download

you need java 17 or higher, download it from oracle or something idk

drag the boze folder into the .minecraft thing and make sure the font isnt 0 bytes

drag the .jar file into the mods folder along with the fabric API (obviously for 1.19.2) you can get it from curseforge

yes it has configs wohoo! as i said it's a 1:1 copy, so download the config file, go to the boze folder (you need to start it for atleast one time so the jar can execute and do its stuff and create its magical files) go to the configs and drag the config (make sure its an .all file) you can import the config with .config import [config name] and you can export too with .config export [a name that you would like for your config] the exported config will of course appear in the configs folder

have fun!!
